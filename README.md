# Ad-Impact-Mediation-Analysis
This project explores mediation models to quantify the effects of "out of home" and social media advertising on sales via awareness. Using Monte Carlo bootstrap for robust confidence intervals, we estimate direct, indirect, and total effects of advertising strategies, aiding strategic marketing decisions.
