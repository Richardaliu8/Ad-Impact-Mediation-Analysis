# Ad-Impact-Mediation-Analysis

Project Overview  
This project applies advanced statistical techniques to analyze how different types of advertising—specifically "out of home" (OOH) and social media—affect sales through the mediator of consumer awareness. Using Monte Carlo bootstrap methods, the project aims to estimate and provide reliable confidence intervals for the mediation, direct, and total effects of these advertising strategies.

Features  
Mediation Model Estimation: Constructs mediation models to explore how OOH and social media advertising impact sales indirectly through increased awareness.  
Monte Carlo Bootstrap: Utilizes Monte Carlo bootstrap techniques to generate 95% confidence intervals, addressing the challenge posed by non-normality and unknown analytical distribution of mediation effects.  
Parameter Estimates: Provides estimates for direct, indirect, and total effects of each advertising type, with detailed confidence interval analysis to gauge the robustness of the results.  
Variable Significance: Identifies and reports the significance of OOH and social media advertising on awareness and sales, offering insights into the efficacy of each advertising type.  
Data Handling: Processes and creates lag variables from the Heineken dataset to align with the requirements of mediation analysis, focusing specifically on OOH and social media advertising.  

Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to quantitatively assess the roles that different advertising strategies play in influencing consumer behavior. By understanding the pathways through which advertising affects sales, businesses can make more informed decisions about where to allocate their marketing resources for maximum impact.
